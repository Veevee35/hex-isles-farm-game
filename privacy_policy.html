<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="meta"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 12, 2025<br>
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 12, 2025</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we (the developers of the <strong>Hex Isles</strong> Discord Activity) collect, use, and protect information when you launch or use our game (“the Activity”). We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We strive to minimize the amount of personal information we collect. The Activity runs within Discord, and it interacts with the Discord API solely to enable game functionality (for example, to invite friends or update activity status). The Activity does not collect or store personally identifiable information (PII) such as your real name, email address, or physical location.</p>
<p>Some technical information may be processed by Discord or third‑party content delivery networks (such as jsDelivr) in order to deliver game assets. This information may include your IP address, user agent, and device data, which are standard HTTP request parameters. We do not have direct access to or control over this technical data.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>To deliver and maintain the Activity’s functionality (e.g., loading game assets through a CDN).</li>
<li>To enable Discord‑specific features such as setting activity status and handling invites.</li>
<li>For analytics and bug fixing (aggregated and anonymized data only).</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

<h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We do not store personal data on our servers. Any transient data accessed via the Discord API is processed in memory solely for the duration of your session and is not retained.</p>

<h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>The Activity itself does not set cookies or use tracking scripts. However, third‑party content delivery networks (CDNs) or Discord may use cookies or other technologies as part of their normal operations. Please refer to the privacy policies of those third parties (e.g., Discord and jsDelivr) for more details on their data practices.</p>

<h2>5. Third‑Party Services</h2>
<p>The Activity is delivered through Discord and loads assets from external services such as jsDelivr. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Discord or these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to understand how they handle your information.</p>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The Activity is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). If we learn that a child under 13 has provided personal data, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

<h2>7. International Users</h2>
<p>We provide the Activity from the United States. If you are accessing the Activity from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States. By using the Activity, you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document. Continued use of the Activity after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

<h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@hexisles.com">privacy@hexisles.com</a>.</p>
