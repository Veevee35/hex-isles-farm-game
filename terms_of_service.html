<h2>5. User Content</h2>

You retain ownership of your User Content but grant us a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to use, reproduce, modify and display your User Content as needed to operate and improve the Activity. You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or transmitting it.</p>

<h2>6. Third‑Party Services</h2>
<p>The Activity is delivered through Discord and may make use of external services (such as content delivery networks) to load resources.

You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Minnesota for any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Activity.</p>

<h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may modify these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (for example, by updating the “Last Updated” date above). Your continued use of the Activity after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
